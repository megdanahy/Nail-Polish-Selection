# Nail Polish Decisions Maker

## Overview
This is a goofy project I'm using to help myself get acclimated to GitHub.
I'm very indecisive when it comes to choosing a nail polish color, so this is supposed to help with that. 
It'll improve as I improve!

## What is it
This is just a way to have the computer pick your nail polish color according to various factors!
It goes down a decision tree to account for season, vibe, and general likes/dislikes so I can choose the best nail color for the week.
